This was a 3rd year university project with the objective of demonstrating some core c++ concepts. I decided to make a project that took  lot of inspiration from Zork but added a visual element through the GUI functions available in Qt. The project was really well recieved and I had a lot of fun creating it. I recieved an A for my efforts.
